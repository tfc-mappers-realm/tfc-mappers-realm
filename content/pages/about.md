**TFC Mappers Realm** is a site on the Internet dedicated to people who play Team
Fortress Classic and are interested in trying out new maps or making a new map
themselves.

It has begun as somewhere I could publish my own TFC mapping related work, but
anyone is free to contribute, a good way to do it is by checking the website
[source-code](https://github.com/tfc-mappers-realm/tfc-mappers-realm) and making
pull requests.

It is also possible to send stuff you made to the following email address:
_yenxp AT hotmail DOT com_

Feel free to contribute with us by sending stuff you have made related to TFC
mapping, such as texts, maps, tools, textures. Because TFC is a mod for
Half-Life, maybe more generic stuff for the GoldSrc engine or maybe even Quake
stuff will serve aswell.

Any comments, suggestions, problems, etc. can also be sent to the email
address above.
