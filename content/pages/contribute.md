Feel free to contribute with **TFC Mappers Realm** by sending stuff you have
made related to TFC mapping, such as texts, maps, tools, textures. Because TFC
is a mod for Half-Life, maybe more generic stuff for the GoldSrc engine or
maybe even Quake stuff will serve aswell.

A good good way to contribute is by checking the website
[source-code](https://github.com/tfc-mappers-realm/tfc-mappers-realm) and making
pull requests.

It is also possible to send stuff you made to the following email address:
_yenxp AT tfcmappers DOT com_
