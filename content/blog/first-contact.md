Hello!

I am known by the Team Fortress Classic (remaining) community under the
nickname Yenx.

I am beggining this website intended for people who like to create maps an those
who would like to see new maps for the mod.

Myself, I am more inclined towards computer programming then the artistic side,
so expect from me more technical stuff. That is why I'll gladly accept
submissions of texts, maps, tools, textures and other resources made by whoever
is willing to ocontribute.

Last, this is completely a side-project of mine, so I won't update it
frequently.

Feel free to contact me on yenxp AT tfcmappers DOT com

Yenx.
