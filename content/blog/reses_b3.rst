Seven years ago I made a small/medium sized ctf map, it was reses_b1. This
month, after Soak started asking me mapping relation questions I went into
mapping again, the result:

**The third beta version of Reses has been released!**

**Download:** `reses_b3 <{static}/downloads/maps/reses_b3.zip>`_

Check out the change-log:

- Enlarged rooms
- Enlarged base entrance
- Taller flagrom
- Faster elevators
- Fixed some textures
- Fixed vox for flags touches and captures
- Rise the skybox a little

Thanks to:

- Soak for helping me testing it and giving ideas
- Venny for suggestions and uploading the map to LATAM server
- LATAM community for keeping the game alive
- All the remaining players

You may be wandering about what happened the the second beta version, well...
I made it one day before the _b3 release but there were some bugs I belived to
be blockers.
