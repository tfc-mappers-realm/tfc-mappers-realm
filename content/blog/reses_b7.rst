New beta version: **reses_b7**!

**Download:** `reses_b7 <{static}/downloads/maps/reses_b7.zip>`_

Some new stuff! I mainly redesigned the resupply and the upper entrance because
it was not blocking VIS from the main hall top left corner to the yard. This
redesign also works better because one of the resupply space is now optimized.
Also made new respawn area in the resupply so now players spawn
facing always the same direction where it is possible to see all exits at once.

The resupply bags now provide onle 30 cells each and their respawn delay has
been increased to 0.8 second so engineers will take a little more time if they
want to build a sentry gun near the resupply to defent the security switch of
the resupply door.

Security downtime has been increased to 60 seconds. This is because players
players respawn near the switch so they could push the defence forwards to
defend it more than the flagroom. A whole minute delay should retreat them after
the security is deactivated.

Lightning was improved in all areas of the map, so everything now looks better.

Actually I skipped the _b5 release on this website so I'm mentioning both
versions changes.
