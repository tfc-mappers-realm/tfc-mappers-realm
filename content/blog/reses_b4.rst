Today I am releasing a new beta version of Reses based on sugestions and map
testing, it is: **reses_b4**!

In the past it was a rather small map but it as enlarged a bit, it has more
open space inside the bases, they layout stils te same, though.
The main differences of this version are the removal of the large central pillar
inside the flagrooms to allow better sentry gun placements and the top flagroom
entrance that has been shrinked, because it looked broken.

**Download:** `reses_b4 <{static}/downloads/maps/reses_b4.zip>`_

Check out the change-log:

- Removed the central 'pillar' inside the flagrooms
- Shrinked flagroom top entrance
- Changed the capture point from the main hall to the battlements
- Bag before the resuply low exit
- Some new details

Thanks to:

- Soak for bringing me back into mapping, for suggestions and for map testing
- Venny for suggestions and uploading the map to LATAM server
- LATAM community for testing the map and keeping the game alive
- All the remaining players
